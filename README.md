The original commit of this repo is a clone of Chris's boilerplate canvas project. 
I've added my own tweaks to understand the logic and to be able to extend it with my own ideas.

To Run this:

1. git clone https://github.com/Asif1924/SimpleSideScroller.git
2. in the project folder, npm install (you need nodejs and npm)
3. then npm start
4. It wil launch in your browser
5. Left, Right, Space (jump) and Shift (speed run) are the controls
